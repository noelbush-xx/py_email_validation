      long_description='''
      This module provides a single method, valid_email_address(), which returns
      True or False to indicate whether a given address is valid according to the
      'addr-spec' part of the specification given in [RFC 2822]
      (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt).  Ideally, we would like to find this
      in some other library, already thoroughly tested and well- maintained.  The
      standard Python library email.utils contains a parse_addr() function, but
      it is not sufficient to detect many malformed addresses.

      This implementation aims to be faithful to the RFC, with the exception of a
      circular definition (see comments inline), and with the omission of the
      pattern components marked as "obsolete".

      Yes, all this really does is build a big regular expression.  But it builds
      it in nice pieces that correspond to the RFC, and there's a big bunch of
      unit tests that try to ensure each little piece of the regexp works as
      intended.  (See test_email_validation.py.)
